              <p class= "section-lead">
                Here are some skills Reese Posses.

              </p>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Marksmanship:</strong> Reese is skilled with any kind of firearm, including shotguns, rifles, submachine guns, sidearms, and even grenade launchers. He shows his skill regularly as he usually shoots hostiles in the shoulder
                            or kneecap to incapacitate them without killing them. He's also skilled enough to use a sniper rifle to blow the front hood off of a car, forcing it to crash.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hand-to-hand combat:</strong> Reese is highly trained in close-quarters battle and hand-to-hand combat. He was able to defeat a gang of punks on a subway with little to no effort. He mostly uses these skills in certain
                            emergency situations, such as when a person of interest is about to be taken hostage. His skills are advanced enough that only a few people have been able to fight him for significant periods of time, let alone defeat him.
                            His fighting style appears to be mix of Krav Maga and Wing Chun.</li>
                        <li><strong>Indomitable will/High tolerance for pain:</strong> Reese has an unbreakable will and a remarkably high threshold for pain. He was once tortured with electricity in Kandahar for sixteen hours simply for refusing to give
                            his captors his name. When former Stasi agent Ulrich Kohl was looking for his wife, he tortured Reese by punching needles into specific nerves on his body, such as the humerus, and Reese never cracked. (“Foe”) In addition,
                            after Carter's death, he went on a one-man search for her killer, even though critically wounded from gunshot wounds. (“The Devil's Share”)</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategist/Tactician:</strong> Reese is shown to be intelligent, and he can quickly come up with tactics and strategies to subdue his opponents with ease. He has also been shown to be able to identify former military personnel
                            by their tactics. Not surprisingly, he can quote from Sun-Tzu's The Art of War. (“Wolf and Cub”)</li>
                    </ul>
